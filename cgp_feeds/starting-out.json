We thought we\u2019d simplify it even further for you with a very comprehensive bullet-point list of top tips for any new investor.\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Learning to invest is not something you can learn overnight, it takes time, patience and research.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;You don\u2019t need a fortune to start your investing career, you can do it with as little as $50. Then maybe invest more as you learn a bit more about the industry and the process involved.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Hire a full-service broker until you really understand the whole process.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Try to stay away from stocks which cost less than $10 a share \u2013 most companies which are worth investing in usually sell at more than that.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;When you\u2019re starting out, invest only in domestic stocks and mutual funds; don\u2019t overcomplicate things.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Diversification is a viable strategy but don\u2019t diversify too much too soon as it will probably confuse you and blur your focus. Just concentrate on a few stocks and watch them carefully.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking: with $10,000 or less invest in 2 or 3 stocks, with $50,000 invest in 4 or 5, and when you have $100,000 or more stick to about 7 or 8 stocks.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Try to stay away from Futures and Options due to their highly speculative nature.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Be prepared to take some losses \u2013 they won\u2019t all be winners. However, try to cut your losses at around 10% below the price you bought at.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Don\u2019t get too emotionally attached to your stocks, they\u2019re not your babies.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Try to avoid the more volatile markets, like futures and foreign stocks.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Analyze every transaction and investment and learn from both mistakes and successes.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Learn to conduct both fundamental and technical analysis of companies you are thinking of investing in. Fundamental analysis involves looking at a company\u2019s earnings, profit margins, growth and return on equity, which allows you to narrow your search down to only good quality stocks, while technical analysis involves reading a stock\u2019s price and volume chart; applied together they allow you to invest in quality companies at the right time.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Try to pick stocks from the leading industry sectors since most of the market leaders from the past were in the leading groups, like Technology, Communications, Software, Leisure and Entertainment.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Stocks go up due to large buying, usually by mutual funds.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;When a stock leader breaks out from a sound base, it should go up by around 25% in two months; if it does this in less than four weeks, don\u2019t sell it because it\u2019s bound to go up way more.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;On the day a stock \u2018breaks out\u2019, volume (the actual number of shares traded) should increase by at least 50%. The most common pattern of a stock with positive gains is called a \u201ccup with handle\u201d because it resembles a cup if you look at it from the side.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Buy stocks at the \u201cpivot point\u201d (the average of the low, high and closing price from the previous day) and don\u2019t buy at any more than 8% above that price.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Don\u2019t worry so much about \u2018buying low\u2019; the best stocks are expensive, but the point is to sell at an even higher price. Stocks which are cheap are generally cheap for a reason.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Use chart price and volume action to determine when a stock has reached its optimum point.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Follow the general market (S&amp;amp;P500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ) even if you have no investments in it due to the fact that 75% of stocks follow trends set in the general market.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;A bear market will cause prices to drop by at least 25% and people refuse to believe that it will ever recover. However, a bull market will usually follow a bear market, and it will be full of opportunities.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;After a period of decline, most indices will attempt to rally (advance in price).&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Technical market indicators are of little value. Using a chart indicator is a good way of determining if the time is right to buy a stock.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Operate in up-trending markets, pick stocks from leading industry groups, and which have strong earnings, high return on equity and increasing profit margins.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;When you buy a stock, buy only half of your desired position at the initial buy point, and then buy more if the price rises by 3% or 4%.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;When a stock shows a major deceleration in growth in its earnings per share over 2 quarters in a row, then it\u2019s time to sell.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;In the stock market\u2026 HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF. ALWAYS.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row full_width=&quot;&quot; parallax=&quot;&quot; parallax_image=&quot;&quot; lvca_dark_bg=&quot;&quot;][vc_column width=&quot;1\/1&quot;][vc_column_text css_animation=&quot;&quot;]\r\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;\/starting-out\/&quot;&gt;View previous articles&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","post_excerpt":"There are many articles out there focusing on investment advice tips for the novice investor, some of which are on this very site and\/or written by our financial experts, and they\u2019re all worth reading if you want to get a good overview of the investment world and understand some of the essential guidelines.

Choosing a security to invest your money into is not an easy task and you have to do a lot of research before making your decision.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are no guarantees that your investment will succeed and deliver superior returns, there are certain \u2018rule of thumb\u2019 indicators or gauges which you can use to guide your decision; one of them is history, since history does repeat itself in the markets.\r\n\r\nA good investment is not one which is cheap, but rather one whereby you invest in a good company, no matter what the cost of the stock. Good solid companies tend to have good pedigree, they don\u2019t just suddenly appear out of nowhere, and these companies are ones which you can normally trust more than others. The same goes for good industries, since some industry sectors are more reliable than others.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve compiled for you a list of the top 50 companies on the 2016 Dividend Aristocrats List, a list of the companies which have managed to increase their dividends for 25 years or more, and which have therefore proven themselves to be successful through several different economic cycles. It\u2019s also important to note the industry sectors which they fall under, and to note that there are three or four sectors which definitely dominate this list.\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;table id=&quot;table-data&quot; width=&quot;506&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;171&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/dividendvaluebuilder.com\/dover-dov-dividend-stock-analysis\/&quot;&gt;Dover\u00a0(DOV)&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/u&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;224&quot;&gt;INDUSTRIALS&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;111&quot;&gt;60 years&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;171&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/dividendvaluebuilder.com\/emerson-electric-emr-dividend-stock-analysis\/&quot;&gt;Emerson Electric (EMR)&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/u&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;224&quot;&gt;INDUSTRIALS&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;111&quot;&gt;59 years&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;171&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/dividendvaluebuilder.com\/genuine-parts-gpc-dividend-stock-analysis\/&quot;&gt;Genuine Parts (GPC)&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/u&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;224&quot;&gt;CONSUMER CYCLICAL&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;111&quot;&gt;59 years&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;171&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/dividendvaluebuilder.com\/procter-gamble-pg-dividend-stock-analysis\/&quot;&gt;Procter &amp;amp; Gamble (PG)&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/u&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;224&quot;&gt;CONSUMER DEFENSIVE&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;111&quot;&gt;59 years&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;171&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/dividendvaluebuilder.com\/3m-mmm-dividend-stock-analysis\/&quot;&gt;3M (MMM)&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/u&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;224&quot;&gt;INDUSTRIALS&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;111&quot;&gt;57 years&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;171&quot;&gt;Cincinnati Fin.

Looking for investment advice?\r\n\r\nThere are lots of things a novice investor has to consider when taking that first plunge into investing their money, which are mostly governed by common sense and also outlined in our DUMMIES\u2019 GUIDE. There are some things which are less obvious but just as important for the discerning potential investor; we\u2019ve summed them up for you.\r\n\r\nMany articles stress the importance of going after long-term gains due to the fact that it\u2019s easier to read a market and identify trends, then piece together the information to work out future movements, as well as due to the fact that a strong company may dip at some point but it will usually come back with positive returns if you are willing to wait. Trying to time the market by jumping in and out is a very difficult thing to do, even for seasoned experienced investors, and it is proven that you will usually underperform the market should you try to do it, especially as a novice investor.\r\n\r\nAnd there are other reasons too. If you trade in the short term, you will end up paying a lot more on commissions, although they may seem insignificant to some; if you are paying $10-15 per trade, this stacks up to a considerable amount over the year. Then you also have tax; short-term capital gains tax is significantly higher than for investments held over the long-term (more than a year) and this will also cut into your profits.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is the risk aspect of investing. While you should never take anything other than a calculated risk, which means investing only after conducting some serious research, and risk should neither be feared nor sought, it should also be noted that you have to take a chance every now and then; the best time to take a risk is at the beginning of your journey, provided you are ready to start your investment career with a loss and not be too affected by it.\r\n\r\nThis is because it is better to make a mistake, and risk losing all your investment, at the start when you are dealing with small bits of money (or at least you should be), and learn some valuable lessons when they are not too costly. And it is also a good way to boost your funds significantly straightaway, if it pays off, and allow yourself to then use maybe half of it to make slow but steady profits. Of course, this all depends on you finding an aggressive stock which makes sense to invest in.\r\n\r\nFinally, we would recommend learning how to invest in index funds. These funds track the market as opposed to trying to beat it, and, because of this more basic mission, and also their large size, they charge much less by way of fees; while mutual funds can charge around 0.7% a year, most ETFs will charge as little as 0.05%-0.09%, which means that to get the same return as your investment in an index fund, the mutual fund must earn 0.7% more for you to get the same returns.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to learn and to consider in the world of investments, but these are some very valuable bits of advice which any new investor should take note of.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","post_excerpt":"","post_terms":"[]","guid":"http:\/\/www.marketmasterclass.com\/?p=297769","post_fmeta":null,"featured_image":"http:\/\/www.marketmasterclass.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/investmentadvice.jpg"},{"ID":"287857","post_title":"Margin of Safety","post_date":"2016-06-21 02:04:13","post_content":"[vc_row full_width=&quot;&quot; parallax=&quot;&quot; parallax_image=&quot;&quot; lvca_dark_bg=&quot;&quot;][vc_column width=&quot;1\/1&quot;][vc_column_text]Margin of safety. Three very important words which you will hear thrown around and which are at the heart of the investment concept; in fact, they\u2019ve often been cited as \u2018the secret of sound investment\u2019. But what do they actually mean?\r\n\r\nThe goal of every investment is to pay less for your security than what it\u2019s actually worth; the \u2018margin of safety\u2019 is the difference between the price you buy a security for and its real value, and the bigger that difference is (with its fundamental value being higher) then the bigger your safety of margin is. It\u2019s calculated quite simply as a percentage of the stock price so, for example, if you buy a security for $90 but you believe, after research and your own calculations, that it should be worth $100, then the margin of safety is 10%.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s extremely difficult to predict the future and only a foolish investor believes that they can accurately forecast what will happen in a certain market, especially in a global business marketplace which can be affected by so many different factors and in so many different ways. It\u2019s therefore imperative that you give yourself a little bit of leeway to account for any unforeseen negative conditions which may arise in the future, meaning that, should there be a downturn in the particular market you\u2019ve entered into and your stock is affected, you might still not lose money on the deal. Furthermore, if conditions turn out better than expected, then your profits will be even higher than what you may have hoped for, and obviously you will reap exponentially greater returns the higher your margin of safety is.\r\n\r\nThe most common mistake that many investors make is not so much paying over the odds for quality investments, but rather from making bad investments in low quality stock during times of general economic growth; it\u2019s all too easy to draw the wrong conclusions about the true worth of a company because of a few good years or a singular event which temporarily boosts the stock\u2019s value, and the only way to assess the real value of a stock is by taking into account the possibility of a company suffering a downswing, the market as a whole taking an unexpected hit, or indeed the age old predicament of an economic cycle going through its natural progression.\r\n\r\nAnother very common mistake that investors make is to overvalue the potential earnings of a \u2018growth stock\u2019, usually due to nothing more than over-excitement and foolish optimism; it makes every investor feel a bit happier with what they\u2019ve invested their money into if they believe that the stock is going to have a meteoric rice. You must be diligent in your research and conservative with your predictions in order to have a better chance of realizing good returns on your investment.\r\n\r\nHowever, the secret is not so much in understanding what the margin of safety is, or even in working out the true value of a company, but rather in having the discipline to actually buy at or below that price, no matter how desperate you are to invest. It\u2019s important to put a number on the margin of safety that you require, and then only invest when you definitely have that safety buffer which is large enough to protect you against any seriously adverse conditions in the future.\r\n\r\nFinally, it\u2019s important to add that diversification is a good companion of the margin of safety and acts upon your portfolio as a whole, and if you, as an investor, put a margin of safety on every investment and then also diversify your portfolio, you increase your chances of achieving positive returns on your investments.\r\n\r\nAs always, being diligent with your research, conservative with your predictions, controlling your greed, and not allowing yourself to become over-excited are the basic components to making the right investments.\r\n\r\nAnd having a margin of safety is the key to it all.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","post_excerpt":"Margin of safety.

Here are some very basic but very useful tips in getting you started.\r\nFirst off, you have to realize that there is no age limit on investing, and the sooner you start, the more chances you have of making more money due to compounding rates of return, which is the cumulative effect that a series of gains or losses have on an original amount of capital over a period of time. Waiting until you\u2019re old enough is not based on any logical basis but merely on the \u2018do it tomorrow\u2019 theory which holds so many people back. As soon as you start earning money you can set aside a certain sum each month, or on a yearly basis, however small it may be, which you know you can use purely for investment purposes.\r\nAnother thing to remember is that there is no minimum number when it comes to investing, and you can start with as little as $50 and build slowly. However, investing becomes more scientific and less risky the more long-term your strategy outlook is, and so it more suited to investors who are willing and able to potentially lock their money into something for ten years or more.\r\n\r\nYou have to also realize that although investing in the stock market or other similar investment assets seems nerve-racking at first, it has also been proven to outperform simple cash saving over the long term due to the fact that banks offer pretty woeful interest rates, often as low as 1.5% which is usually barely above inflation rate. So, while investing your cash in a savings account may be the least volatile, less risky way to go, it\u2019s also the path which will offer you the lowest return on your money.\r\nThe first thing you have to do is research; read up on the different assets available, from stocks and bonds to alternatives, until you understand the advantages and disadvantages of each one; work out what type of broker you want by choosing either a discount broker (who will leave most of the research to you) and a full-service broker (who will do all the legwork for you); then go through what seem like the best ones and do some thorough research on each of them before settling on one; then you have to choose the investment vehicle you wish to employ, and choosing a mutual fund is normally the safest course of action for a beginner due to the fact that you are minimizing the transaction costs (you are splitting them with others), it\u2019s a very affordable way to invest in lots of different asset classes, and also you will be relying on a fund manager whose expertize will (hopefully) allow you to get good returns on your investment; and then, finally, speak to people with first-hand knowledge of investing, in other words, experienced investors.\r\n\r\nOne thing they\u2019ll probably tell you is to start with what you know \u2013 if you own an IPhone and you think that IPhones will become even more popular in the future, then start your research by looking into news about IPhones or Apple as a company, and if you have conviction in your beliefs after you\u2019ve completed your research, you can start investing; it\u2019s easier to understand the pitfalls or potential returns of a certain investment if the subject matter is something which you have an inherent understanding of.\r\nDiversification is also another sound strategy for the novice investor since it minimizes the chances that you have made the wrong choice with your investments; the chances of you, providing you are diligent with your research, getting every investment wrong or all the markets you have invested in experiencing a downturn at the same time are low, so you are then covering yourself for individual mistakes or bad luck; especially if you diversify across different assets, different markets and even using different vehicles. Also, usually, as one market falls another will rise so it will help cover your losses.\r\n\r\nThere are many other things to consider but these are the basics, the first things you need to consider when starting out on your investment journey.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row full_width=&quot;&quot; parallax=&quot;&quot; parallax_image=&quot;&quot; lvca_dark_bg=&quot;&quot;][vc_column width=&quot;1\/1&quot;][vc_column_text]\r\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;\/starting-out\/&quot;&gt;View previous articles&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","post_excerpt":"The starting point of any investment journey is always the same place; you have some spare money and you want to put it to work, you want to watch it grow and go some way into securing a brighter future for you and your loved ones.
