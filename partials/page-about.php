					<h4>Shaun Hurley</h4>
					<hr />
					<p>Shaun started off in sales at a very young age, trading in the markets before moving into insurance and pensions. Fresh out of his teens he took a bold decision to take his future into his own hands and invested some money in stocks, managing to make a good profit in the process. He then left England while still in his early twenties and moved to Europe where he lived in several different countries while engaging in his favorite pastime; gambling. He eventually became a full-time gambler and spent a few years living the hectic life of a punter, before moving to Asia and deciding to step out of the gambling circuit in order to settle down, stepping back into sales with the safe gamble of Divest Media. He loves making nothing into something and turning ideas into money.</p>
